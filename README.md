# java-word2vec-util

This is a utility for loading vector models generated with [Mikolov's standard C implementation of word2vec](http://word2vec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/word2vec.c) and a port of the command line [distance routine](http://word2vec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/distance.c). It is written in pure Java (no external dependencies) and loads models from binary or plain text.
